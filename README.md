# 3rd Place – Threat Modeling Hackathon 2025 | Executive-First Threat Model for Autonomous Driving System

Title:
TMC-Drive: Autonomous Driving Threat Model – 3rd Place (Hackathon 2025)

Overview:
As team lead, I guided Team 55 through the 2025 Threat Modeling Hackathon hosted by Threat Modeling Connect, where we placed 3rd out of 55 teams.

Our entry focused on modeling threats to TMC-Drive, a fictional fully autonomous driving system. We concentrated specifically on real-time operations during the trip, where safety, privacy, and business risks intersect most critically.

Key Contributions:
	•	Led cross-functional team collaboration to deliver a CISO-first threat model.
	•	Balanced security (STRIDE) and privacy (LINDDUN) frameworks across the system architecture.
	•	Implemented a cumulative voting method for simple, transparent threat prioritization.
	•	Developed an innovative five-category assumptions framework (Model, Organizational, Attack, Data-Driven, Architecture) to define scope and focus analysis.
	•	Mapped threats directly to business and regulatory impacts to drive actionable mitigation recommendations.

Recognition:
Our work was praised by judges for executive-ready communication, business risk alignment, and transparent prioritization methodology.
